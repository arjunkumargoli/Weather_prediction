 Weather Prediction using Machine Learning
This project uses historical weather data to predict future weather conditions using various machine learning models. It is built using Python and common data science libraries.

📌 Objective
To analyze historical weather data and build a machine learning model that predicts a specific weather parameter (e.g., temperature, rainfall, humidity).
